On February 22nd, students of the “Japanese American Internment” class visited the Courage and Compassion exhibit on display at the Baron gallery. Unlike most of the class, I had a personal attachment to the exhibit, as I worked on it last semester with Professor Renee Romano. However, upon seeing the finished product, I felt a need to distance myself from many of the harmful narratives that the exhibit imparted. 
Before going into the specifics of what I found problematic, it is important to understand how the Courage and Compassion exhibit came to be. A few years ago, the Go For Broke Foundation reached out to Renee Romano and nine other institutions to ask if they would be interested in hosting a traveling exhibit about Japanese American Internment. This foundation, which is known for producing narratives that are very patriotic and war-centric, was originally founded to commemorate Japanese American soldiers. Understanding the foundation’s reputation, Professor Romano was hesitant to accept the offer in the first place. However, after meeting with members of the Asian American Alliance on campus and receiving assurance from the foundation that the exhibit would contain some small hints to military narratives but would also focus on other important aspects of the Japanese American experience and mass incarceration of WWII, she accepted the offer. 

The permanent site of the Courage and Compassion exhibit and the Go For Broke Foundation is in Los Angeles. The foundation offered to fly Romano, along with representatives from the other institutions hosting the exhibit, to LA to meet with members of Go For Broke in person and tour the Japanese History Museum to get a better idea of the narrative that they were trying to build around this subject. Romano couldn’t attend this meeting so Julie Min, an Oberlin resident and former exhibit developer with knowledge about Japanese American Internment, took her place. The history department was also sent a script of the exhibit beforehand. When talking to Romano, she said that this script gave the department a fairly good idea of what the traveling exhibit would entail. However, they were not completely positive what the exhibit would look like until it actually came to Oberlin. It is important to note that the only panels of the exhibit that the history department was responsible for were those pertaining to Oberlin. Everything else was created by the Go For Broke Foundation. 

The physical aesthetics of the exhibit itself are well done. It is clearly separated into four segments; an introductory section, a section spanning from 1942-1945, a section about Oberlin’s involvement, and a section about the present. The exhibit begins with interactive pieces that ask about instances of courage, as well as addresses huge thematic questions concerning race and war. Then, with the help of sleek gray and green panels, the exhibit leads the visitors through their version of the story of “The Japanese American Experience” during WWII. 

Disappointingly,  the narrative put forth by this section of the exhibit is not one that I feel correctly represents the mass incarceration that took place in the 1940’s. This exhibit undeniably contains the strong military influence that Go For Broke is known for and implies problematic themes. Granted, Japanese American Internment as a whole is usually swept under the rug of American history, and as I overheard an individual say in the exhibit, “At least we’re talking about it.” Nonetheless, this exhibit perpetuates an extremely toxic mentality regarding patriotism. Where the specific conditions of the camps should have been talked about, the military involvement and achievements of Japanese American individuals were discussed instead. The viewer comes away from the exhibit well-versed in the military achievements of the 442nd Infantry Regiment but with little specific knowledge pertaining to the humanitarian crimes committed by the United States against Japanese Americans. I believe that this selective narrative perpetuates the idea that minority groups must prove their worth as American citizens by serving in the military. The same narrative has been used about African American troops in the Civil War, Hispanic Americans in World War I, and the Tuskegee Airmen in World War II. As I’ve said, it is *extremely* toxic to reinforce the idea that citizenship is proven through willingness to participate in war. 

The Oberlin section of the exhibit is vastly different. The “courage and compassion” explored in these panels does not pertain to soldiers, but rather refers to the interned Japanese Americans who were brave enough to continue their education at Oberlin. Interestingly enough, the only time that the military is mentioned in this section is during the piece discussing Oberlin’s V-12 unit. The blurb describes how there was racial tension between the unit and the Japanese American students. This section of the exhibit focused on the actual experience of the students and didn’t cast said experience in the patriotic light of the Go For Broke Foundation’s narrative. 

Despite being disappointed with this exhibit as a whole, I am extremely grateful to have have been trusted to work on a project as public as this one as a first-year. Professor Romano has welcomed me into her field of study and has made me feel at home in the history department. However, as my friend said as I was writing this article, “even if people have welcomed you in and treated you like family, you need to hold your family accountable.” The history department may not have written the panels that perpetuate the aforementioned “toxic narrative,” but they did approve a script that did so. Hopefully, the department will learn from this experience and the next exhibit they run will be one that is less problematic and more in line with the values of the department as a whole.
