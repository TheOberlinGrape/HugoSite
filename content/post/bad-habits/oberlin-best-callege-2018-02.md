Oberlin College firmly believes in the potential of the individual. It strives to empower its students and send them out into the world with the tools and ambition to change it. However, Oberlin maintains a controversial place in mainstream America, with some believing it is home to more snowflakes than a 3rd grade classroom in January.

It comes as somewhat of a surprise, then, that a recent study by the Pew Research Center found that Oberlin College is widely considered to be the best higher education institution geographically located in Oberlin, Ohio. The study, which surveyed over 200 adults in Kipton, Pittsfield, and Elyria, asked, “Do you think that Oberlin College is the best College or University located in Oberlin?” With over 93% of respondents answering “I guess,” it is clear that the stereotypes and derogations so commonly placed on this college and the students within do not hold true on the sidewalks of the city street…or at least in the soy fields along State Route 303.

The reasons listed by the study for this astounding achievement include “the ability of the students to stay angry at random administrators for inhuman amounts of time,” “a conservationist attitude toward renovating historical living spaces,” and “the positivity of the student body despite the understanding they will never actually be able to make a career out of what they are studying.” 

Opinions over this news vary. Jaden Smith ‘19, said “This is great! Now I can justify to my parents why they are paying close to $70,000 a year on my study of Linguistic Anthropology in Ancient Babylonia while spending my Saturday nights alone in my room with a bottle of Barefoot Wine and an entire season of Rugrats,” while a second-year who wished to remain anonymous complained, “The only reason I’m even here is because I enjoy complaining about how much I hate this school to my friends back home until they think I’m a masochist, which is my preferred aesthetic. Now that Oberlin is considered an objectively good school I’ll have to find other things to be ironically sad about.”

Notably upset over the study is Oberlin’s lesser known neighbor to the South, Lorain County JVS, the technical school lying just beyond the point on Route 58 that no Obie ever crosses, despite them telling all their friends about all the amazing times they’ve had in Columbus. In response to the study, JVS has announced a 10-year master plan, which includes placing a student representative on the board of administrators, building an entire new facility, and breeding the now-extinct albino squirrels and populating them throughout their campus.
